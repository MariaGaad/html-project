    <h2><a>
Artificial Intelligence is a large computer science branch dedicated to the development of intelligent machines that are capable of carrying out tasks usually requiring human intelligence. AI is a multidisciplinary science, but advances in machine and deep learning create a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the technology industry.
In essence, AI is the IT industry, which seeks to offer an affirmative answer to Turing 's question. It is the effort for human intelligence on machines to be replicated or simulated.

There were numerous questions and debates on the expansive objective of artificial intelligence. So much that there is no general acceptance of any single field description.


The key restriction in describing AI simply as "smart building machinery," is that what artificial intelligence actually is not explained? How intelligent is a machine?



The authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach this question by combining their work on the topic of intelligent machine agents in their ground-breaking work, Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach. In this context, AI is "the study of agents who receive environmental perceptions and perform actions."(Russel and Norvig viii)

Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:
</a></h2>
<li><a>1-Thinking humanly </a></li>
<li><a>2-Thinking rationally</a></li>
<li><a>3-Acting humanly</a></li>
<li><a>4-Acting rationally</a></li>
    <h2><a>
The two first theories are about thought and reasoning, the other two are about behaviour. She stressed that "all the skills needed for Turing Tests are capable of a reasonable entity also being able to act" (Russel and Norvig 4). (Norvig and Russell)

The Ford professor of artificial intelligence and information science at MIT, Patrick Winston, defines AI as "algorithms that allow for constraints and expose models that support models that tie thinking, perception and action together."

While these concepts can seem to the average person abstract, they help focus on the field as a computer science area and include machine learning and other artificial intelligence compounds as a framework to infuse machinery and programs.


DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin began his address in 2017 with the following description of the way in which AI is used today, while addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience:

"AI is a computer system able to carry out jobs that are usually human intelligence ... Many of these artificial systems are powered by machine learning, some by deep learning and others by boring things like rules." </a></h2>
