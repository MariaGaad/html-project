    <h2><a>The term 'artificial intelligence' was coined in 1956 and today, due to increased volumes of data, advanced algorithms and improvements to computer power and storage AI has become increasingly popular.


In early AI studies in the fifties, issues such as problem solving and symbolic methods were explored. In the 1960s this kind of work was taken care of by the US Department of Defense and computers were trained to imitate basic human reasoning. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) finalized street mapping projects in the 1970s, for example. And in 2003, well before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names, DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants.

This first work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning we see today in computers, including decision-making support systems and intelligent search systems which can complement and enhance human skills.


While Hollywood films and science fiction novels portray AI as human-like robots, the current developments in AI technologies are not so frightening â€“ or quite clever. Rather, AI has grown to offer many specific advantages in all industries. Continue reading the latest artificial intelligence examples of wellness, retail and more.
